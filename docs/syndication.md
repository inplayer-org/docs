The InPlayer platform features syndication products that enable you, our merchants, to maximize reach and distribution of your pay-per-view events and subscription content. 
Our syndication products enable you to grow the number of your publishers, partners and any interested party via far-and-wide distribution, referred to as Freestyle Syndication, or via a selective kind of distribution, referred to as Controlled Syndication.

## Freestyle Syndication

You can distribute your monetised event(s) far and wide to an unlimited number of publishers by simply creating an embed code via our platform and then distributing it around through your channels of choice (social media, email database, blog posts, etc.). In other words, you harness external traffic to drive revenue with ease.

### Creating OAuth App

To begin with, first you need to create an OAuth app by simply logging into the InPlayer dashboard (https://dashboard.inplayer.com/dashboard) with your merchant account. The OAuth feature enables you to group the customers from one website into one user group, and those from another website to another group. That way, you have full visibility over every registration and sale across all destinations. 

For step-by-step instructions on how to create an OAuth app, refer here: 

https://inplayer.com/docs/settings/auth/#oauth 
https://inplayer.com/docs/settings/auth/#creating-oauth-app

Having your OAuth app created, you can continue to provide your syndication partners with a customised branding theme, constructing and providing them with an embed code of the concerned asset(s), and you can experience the possibility of filtering and generating reports about your partners' revenue. 

### Creating a Branding Theme 

You are also given the option of providing the syndicated paywall in the default look and feel, or creating a branded paywall, upon the syndication partners' preference, with their logo and colours applied. Using a theme that fits your publishers' brand gives them the sense of personality, and their customers, the sense of familiarity. To learn more about branding the appearance of your paywall, proceed here:

Constructing Paywall Embed Code

Once you have your OAuth app created, you need to attach it to your asset(s). Next, you need to provide your syndication partner(s) with the InPlayer embed code for a given asset (https://inplayer.com/docs/assets/kaltura-asset/#embedding-the-asset), so they can incorporate it into their website and start selling.

### Filtering and Generating Reports

Granted you have your user grouping visibility, you can manage and control any reporting, any revenue share calculations, and all outpayments to third party publishers easily. You can achieve this either by filtering data using a search filter from a 'Search' bar or by using the 'Generate Report' option.

Inserting the 'oauth app key' in the 'Search' bar within the 'Audience' section at your dashboard enables you to filter all the registered customers to a specific OAuth app. The 'Search' bar is designed to work by selecting one of the offered defining filters, in this case the 'oauth app key', and then typing its value. In addition, you can also choose to have filtered a list of the 'active' or 'deactivated' customers.  

For more details on the 'Audience' section refer here: 

https://inplayer.com/docs/dashboard/audience/

In the same manner, you can base your search at the 'Payments' or 'Subscriptions' section, in order to have filtered the payments and subscriptions that the registered customers to a given OAuth app have realized.


Aside from filtering the relevant information, you can have them generated as a report containing information about the audience, payments or subscriptions for a specific OAuth app. Start by clicking the 'Generate Report' button from either the 'Audience','Payments' or 'Subscriptions' section, according to the type of information you need. Next, select the OAuth app of interest, the time frame of relevance, and choose the columns you want included in your report. 
A report generated from the 'Audience' section will include the audience registered on the selected OAuth app; a report generated from the 'Payments' section will include the payments carried out by the audience for the selected OAuth app, and a report generated from the 'Subscriptions' section will include the subscriptions made by the audience for the given OAuth app.
Once you have your report generated, click on 'View Reports' button to view it and download it as a CVS file for any further use.

## Controlled Syndication 

The idea behind Controlled Syndication is you, as a merchant, to be able to create a direct relationship with selected party of your syndication partners and drive pay-per-view events and subscriptions via that selected party, in a personalised manner. To form that direct relationship, you need to create a main account (master) and multiple sub-accounts (related). For that purpose, you can rely on our powerful tool, InPlayer Relate.

### InPlayer Relate

Via the InPlayer Relate you create related accounts for a selected party of your syndication partners in order to provide them with visibility to their own reporting, registrations, revenue, etc. However, you via your master account, have full control and visibility of the registrations and revenue from all related accounts. This sort of relationship enables you to access any related account from your master account without a requirement for inserting password. You can also set predefined revenue shares for each of your syndication partners, as well as enabling automated outpayments to those partners.

### Branded Paywall

Much like with Freestyle Syndication, via the Controlled Syndication you can provide your selected party of publishers with a paywall customised in their own brand, look, and feel. 

### Filtering and Generating Reports

The Controlled Syndication enables both you and your publishers to be able to generate reports regarding the registrations and revenue of interest.
