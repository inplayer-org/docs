The InPlayer Platform consists 3 core service groups. Identity Management/Authentication, Payments/Subscriptions and Access Entitlement/Validation for Digital Assets. You can chose to use the core services in a connected way, where InPlayer will manage your complete solution, or you can just use part of the services and switch the rest with your own or 3rd party implementation. 

The Inplayer platform flexibility in terms of standalone services allows 3 different scenarios:

* **Have your own Identity Management/Athentication and use InPlayer's Payments and Access Entitlement**
* **Have your own Payment Solution and use InPlayer Authentication and Access Entitlement/Access Validation** 
* **Have both Payment and Authentication Solutions and use InPlayer for secure Access Management**   

For all each of these solutions an apropriate implementation needs to be integrated in order co connect all parts. In the following tutorial we will take a closer look about how to achieve each of them along with apropriate details for connection with some of the Paywall Application functionalities and embedable Web UI screens, although most of such functionalites should be integrated and connected to your other parts via back-end managment.
