The InPlayer platform facilitates the payment process by providing in-app purchases (IAPs) as a valid payment method i.e. by supporting payments carried out inside native Android, iOS, or TV applications. 
In-app purchasing allows you, as a merchant, to supply your customers with special offers (extra features or premium content behind a paywall) within an application as a way of providing a cross-platform monetization flow directly on their TV or on their iOS or Android device.  

In addition you can find discussed in detail the steps our platform undertakes in order to enable in-app purchases.
